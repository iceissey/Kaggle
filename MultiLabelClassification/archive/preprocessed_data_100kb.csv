"Reconstructing Subject-Specific Effect Maps   Predictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease
related alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can
be made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the
subject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual
measurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely
used, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,
is rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of
dispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction
method, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive
modeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically
aims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite
sample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type
algorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic
manner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed
as a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are
estimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental
evaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on
synthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy
compared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the
ADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between
subject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers
of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score
and Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\beta$ levels. Further reliability studies on
the longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when
RSM is used.

natural generalisation of spherical harmonics. In particular we study the
theory of zonal polyharmonics, which allows us, analogously to zonal harmonics,
to construct Poisson kernels for polyharmonic functions on the union of rotated
balls. We find the representation of Poisson kernels and zonal polyharmonics in
terms of the Gegenbauer polynomials. We show the connection between the
classical Poisson kernel for harmonic functions on the ball, Poisson kernels
for polyharmonic functions on the union of rotated balls, and the Cauchy-Hua
kernel for holomorphic functions on the Lie ball.

"A finite element approximation for the stochastic Maxwell--Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert system   The stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert (LLG) equation coupled with the
Maxwell equations (the so called stochastic MLLG system) describes the creation
of domain walls and vortices (fundamental objects for the novel nanostructured
magnetic memories). We first reformulate the stochastic LLG equation into an
equation with time-differentiable solutions. We then propose a convergent
$\theta$-linear scheme to approximate the solutions of the reformulated system.
As a consequence, we prove convergence of the approximate solutions, with no or
minor conditions on time and space steps (depending on the value of $\theta$).
Hence, we prove the existence of weak martingale solutions of the stochastic
MLLG system. Numerical results are presented to show applicability of the
method.

"On maximizing the fundamental frequency of the complement of an obstacle   Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded domain satisfying a
Hayman-type asymmetry condition, and let $ D $ be an arbitrary bounded domain

of the set $ x+D $ to the set of maximum points $ x_0 $ of the first Dirichlet

"Adverse effects of polymer coating on heat transport at solid-liquid interface   The ability of metallic nanoparticles to supply heat to a liquid environment
under exposure to an external optical field has attracted growing interest for
biomedical applications. Controlling the thermal transport properties at a
solid-liquid interface then appears to be particularly relevant. In this work,
we address the thermal transport between water and a gold surface coated by a
polymer layer. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that
increasing the polymer density displaces the domain resisting to the heat flow,
while it doesn't affect the final amount of thermal energy released in the
liquid. This unexpected behavior results from a trade-off established by the
increasing polymer density which couples more efficiently with the solid but
initiates a counterbalancing resistance with the liquid.

"$\mathcal{R}_{0}$ fails to predict the outbreak potential in the presence of natural-boosting immunity   Time varying susceptibility of host at individual level due to waning and

of host susceptibility on the shot-term behavior of epidemics is not

account natural-boosting immunity by reinfection, and obtained the explicit

"A global sensitivity analysis and reduced order models for hydraulically-fractured horizontal wells   We present a systematic global sensitivity analysis using the Sobol method
which can be utilized to rank the variables that affect two quantity of
interests -- pore pressure depletion and stress change -- around a
hydraulically-fractured horizontal well based on their degree of importance.
These variables include rock properties and stimulation design variables. A
fully-coupled poroelastic hydraulic fracture model is used to account for pore
pressure and stress changes due to production. To ease the computational cost
of a simulator, we also provide reduced order models (ROMs), which can be used
to replace the complex numerical model with a rather simple analytical model,
for calculating the pore pressure and stresses at different locations around
hydraulic fractures. The main findings of this research are: (i) mobility,
production pressure, and fracture half-length are the main contributors to the
changes in the quantities of interest. The percentage of the contribution of
each parameter depends on the location with respect to pre-existing hydraulic
fractures and the quantity of interest. (ii) As the time progresses, the effect
of mobility decreases and the effect of production pressure increases. (iii)
These two variables are also dominant for horizontal stresses at large
distances from hydraulic fractures. (iv) At zones close to hydraulic fracture
tips or inside the spacing area, other parameters such as fracture spacing and
half-length are the dominant factors that affect the minimum horizontal stress.
The results of this study will provide useful guidelines for the stimulation
design of legacy wells and secondary operations such as refracturing and infill

"Role-separating ordering in social dilemmas controlled by topological frustration   ""Three is a crowd"" is an old proverb that applies as much to social
interactions, as it does to frustrated configurations in statistical physics
models. Accordingly, social relations within a triangle deserve special
attention. With this motivation, we explore the impact of topological
frustration on the evolutionary dynamics of the snowdrift game on a triangular
lattice. This topology provides an irreconcilable frustration, which prevents
anti-coordination of competing strategies that would be needed for an optimal
outcome of the game. By using different strategy updating protocols, we observe
complex spatial patterns in dependence on payoff values that are reminiscent to
a honeycomb-like organization, which helps to minimize the negative consequence
of the topological frustration. We relate the emergence of these patterns to
the microscopic dynamics of the evolutionary process, both by means of
mean-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations. For comparison, we also
consider the same evolutionary dynamics on the square lattice, where of course
the topological frustration is absent. However, with the deletion of diagonal
links of the triangular lattice, we can gradually bridge the gap to the square
lattice. Interestingly, in this case the level of cooperation in the system is
a direct indicator of the level of topological frustration, thus providing a
method to determine frustration levels in an arbitrary interaction network.

"Dynamics of exciton magnetic polarons in CdMnSe/CdMgSe quantum wells: the effect of self-localization   We study the exciton magnetic polaron (EMP) formation in (Cd,Mn)Se/(Cd,Mg)Se
diluted-magnetic-semiconductor quantum wells using time-resolved
photoluminescence (PL). The magnetic field and temperature dependencies of this
dynamics allow us to separate the non-magnetic and magnetic contributions to
the exciton localization. We deduce the EMP energy of 14 meV, which is in
agreement with time-integrated measurements based on selective excitation and
the magnetic field dependence of the PL circular polarization degree. The
polaron formation time of 500 ps is significantly longer than the corresponding
values reported earlier. We propose that this behavior is related to strong
self-localization of the EMP, accompanied with a squeezing of the heavy-hole
envelope wavefunction. This conclusion is also supported by the decrease of the
exciton lifetime from 600 ps to 200 - 400 ps with increasing magnetic field and

"On Varieties of Ordered Automata   The classical Eilenberg correspondence, based on the concept of the syntactic
monoid, relates varieties of regular languages with pseudovarieties of finite
monoids. Various modifications of this correspondence appeared, with more
general classes of regular languages on one hand and classes of more complex
algebraic structures on the other hand. For example, classes of languages need
not be closed under complementation or all preimages under homomorphisms, while
monoids can be equipped with a compatible order or they can have a
distinguished set of generators. Such generalized varieties and pseudovarieties
also have natural counterparts formed by classes of finite (ordered) automata.
In this paper the previous approaches are combined. The notion of positive
$\mathcal C$-varieties of ordered semiautomata (i.e. no initial and final
states are specified) is introduced and their correspondence with positive
$\mathcal C$-varieties of languages is proved.

spiral galaxy M51 that belongs to a spiral density wave and exhibits nine gas
spurs. The combined observations of the(ionized, atomic, molecular, dusty)
interstellar medium (ISM) with star formation tracers (HII regions, young
<10Myr stellar clusters) suggest (1) no variation in giant molecular cloud
(GMC) properties between arm and gas spurs, (2) gas spurs and extinction
feathers arising from the same structure with a close spatial relation between
gas spurs and ongoing/recent star formation (despite higher gas surface
densities in the spiral arm), (3) no trend in star formation age either along
the arm or along a spur, (4) evidence for strong star formation feedback in gas
spurs: (5) tentative evidence for star formation triggered by stellar feedback
for one spur, and (6) GMC associations (GMAs) being no special entities but the
result of blending of gas arm/spur cross-sections in lower resolution
observations. We conclude that there is no evidence for a coherent star
formation onset mechanism that can be solely associated to the presence of the
spiral density wave. This suggests that other (more localized) mechanisms are
important to delay star formation such that it occurs in spurs. The evidence of
star formation proceeding over several million years within individual spurs
implies that the mechanism that leads to star formation acts or is sustained
over a longer time-scale.

"Comparing Covariate Prioritization via Matching to Machine Learning Methods for Causal Inference using Five Empirical Applications   When investigators seek to estimate causal effects, they often assume that
selection into treatment is based only on observed covariates. Under this

basic regression models have long been the dominant method of statistical
adjustment, more robust methods based on matching or weighting have become more
common. Of late, even more flexible methods based on machine learning methods
have been developed for statistical adjustment. These machine learning methods
are designed to be black box methods with little input from the researcher.
Recent research used a data competition to evaluate various methods of
statistical adjustment and found that black box methods out performed all other
methods of statistical adjustment. Matching methods with covariate
prioritization are designed for direct input from substantive investigators in
direct contrast to black methods. In this article, we use a different research

We use black box methods to replicate results from five studies where matching
with covariate prioritization was used to customize the statistical adjustment
in direct response to substantive expertise. We find little difference across
the methods. We conclude with advice for investigators.

"Acoustic Impedance Calculation via Numerical Solution of the Inverse Helmholtz Problem   Assigning homogeneous boundary conditions, such as acoustic impedance, to the
thermoviscous wave equations (TWE) derived by transforming the linearized
Navier-Stokes equations (LNSE) to the frequency domain yields a so-called
Helmholtz solver, whose output is a discrete set of complex eigenfunction and
eigenvalue pairs. The proposed method -- the inverse Helmholtz solver (iHS) --
reverses such procedure by returning the value of acoustic impedance at one or
more unknown impedance boundaries (IBs) of a given domain via spatial
integration of the TWE for a given real-valued frequency with assigned
conditions on other boundaries. The iHS procedure is applied to a second-order
spatial discretization of the TWEs derived on an unstructured grid with
staggered grid arrangement. The momentum equation only is extended to the
center of each IB face where pressure and velocity components are co-located
and treated as unknowns. One closure condition considered for the iHS is the
assignment of the surface gradient of pressure phase over the IBs,
corresponding to assigning the shape of the acoustic waveform at the IB. The
iHS procedure is carried out independently for each frequency in order to
return the complete broadband complex impedance distribution at the IBs in any
desired frequency range. The iHS approach is first validated against Rott's
theory for both inviscid and viscous, rectangular and circular ducts. The
impedance of a geometrically complex toy cavity is then reconstructed and
verified against companion full compressible unstructured Navier-Stokes
simulations resolving the cavity geometry and one-dimensional impedance test
tube calculations based on time-domain impedance boundary conditions (TDIBC).
The iHS methodology is also shown to capture thermoacoustic effects, with
reconstructed impedance values quantitatively in agreement with thermoacoustic
growth rates.

"Deciphering noise amplification and reduction in open chemical reaction networks   The impact of random fluctuations on the dynamical behavior a complex
biological systems is a longstanding issue, whose understanding would shed
light on the evolutionary pressure that nature imposes on the intrinsic noise
levels and would allow rationally designing synthetic networks with controlled
noise. Using the Itō stochastic differential equation formalism, we performed
both analytic and numerical analyses of several model systems containing
different molecular species in contact with the environment and interacting
with each other through mass-action kinetics. These systems represent for
example biomolecular oligomerization processes, complex-breakage reactions,
signaling cascades or metabolic networks. For chemical reaction networks with
zero deficiency values, which admit a detailed- or complex-balanced steady
state, all molecular species are uncorrelated. The number of molecules of each
species follow a Poisson distribution and their Fano factors, which measure the
intrinsic noise, are equal to one. Systems with deficiency one have an
unbalanced non-equilibrium steady state and a non-zero S-flux, defined as the
flux flowing between the complexes multiplied by an adequate stoichiometric
coefficient. In this case, the noise on each species is reduced if the flux
flows from the species of lowest to highest complexity, and is amplified is the
flux goes in the opposite direction. These results are generalized to systems
of deficiency two, which possess two independent non-vanishing S-fluxes, and we
conjecture that a similar relation holds for higher deficiency systems.

memory crossbar arrays. To verify the validity of the proposed method, we
simulated various neural network with MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset using two
different specific Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) model. Simulation
results show that our proposed neural network produces significantly higher

"Rate-Distortion Region of a Gray-Wyner Model with Side Information   In this work, we establish a full single-letter characterization of the
rate-distortion region of an instance of the Gray-Wyner model with side
information at the decoders. Specifically, in this model an encoder observes a
pair of memoryless, arbitrarily correlated, sources $(S^n_1,S^n_2)$ and
communicates with two receivers over an error-free rate-limited link of
capacity $R_0$, as well as error-free rate-limited individual links of
capacities $R_1$ to the first receiver and $R_2$ to the second receiver. Both
receivers reproduce the source component $S^n_2$ losslessly; and Receiver $1$
also reproduces the source component $S^n_1$ lossily, to within some prescribed
fidelity level $D_1$. Also, Receiver $1$ and Receiver $2$ are equipped
respectively with memoryless side information sequences $Y^n_1$ and $Y^n_2$.
Important in this setup, the side information sequences are arbitrarily
correlated among them, and with the source pair $(S^n_1,S^n_2)$; and are not
assumed to exhibit any particular ordering. Furthermore, by specializing the
main result to two Heegard-Berger models with successive refinement and
scalable coding, we shed light on the roles of the common and private
descriptions that the encoder should produce and what they should carry
optimally. We develop intuitions by analyzing the developed single-letter
optimal rate-distortion regions of these models, and discuss some insightful
binary examples.

"Fourier-based numerical approximation of the Weertman equation for moving dislocations   This work discusses the numerical approximation of a nonlinear
reaction-advection-diffusion equation, which is a dimensionless form of the
Weertman equation. This equation models steadily-moving dislocations in
materials science. It reduces to the celebrated Peierls-Nabarro equation when
its advection term is set to zero. The approach rests on considering a
time-dependent formulation, which admits the equation under study as its
long-time limit. Introducing a Preconditioned Collocation Scheme based on
Fourier transforms, the iterative numerical method presented solves the
time-dependent problem, delivering at convergence the desired numerical
solution to the Weertman equation. Although it rests on an explicit
time-evolution scheme, the method allows for large time steps, and captures the
solution in a robust manner. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the
approach for several types of nonlinearities.

"Suzaku Analysis of the Supernova Remnant G306.3-0.9 and the Gamma-ray View of Its Neighborhood   We present an investigation of the supernova remnant (SNR) G306.3$-$0.9 using
archival multi-wavelength data. The Suzaku spectra are well described by
two-component thermal plasma models: The soft component is in ionization
equilibrium and has a temperature $\sim$0.59 keV, while the hard component has
temperature $\sim$3.2 keV and ionization time-scale $\sim$$2.6\times10^{10}$
cm$^{-3}$ s. We clearly detected Fe K-shell line at energy of $\sim$6.5 keV

"Covariances, Robustness, and Variational Bayes   Mean-field Variational Bayes (MFVB) is an approximate Bayesian posterior
inference technique that is increasingly popular due to its fast runtimes on
large-scale datasets. However, even when MFVB provides accurate posterior means
for certain parameters, it often mis-estimates variances and covariances.
Furthermore, prior robustness measures have remained undeveloped for MFVB. By
deriving a simple formula for the effect of infinitesimal model perturbations
on MFVB posterior means, we provide both improved covariance estimates and
local robustness measures for MFVB, thus greatly expanding the practical
usefulness of MFVB posterior approximations. The estimates for MFVB posterior
covariances rely on a result from the classical Bayesian robustness literature
relating derivatives of posterior expectations to posterior covariances and
include the Laplace approximation as a special case. Our key condition is that
the MFVB approximation provides good estimates of a select subset of posterior
means---an assumption that has been shown to hold in many practical settings.
In our experiments, we demonstrate that our methods are simple, general, and
fast, providing accurate posterior uncertainty estimates and robustness
measures with runtimes that can be an order of magnitude faster than MCMC.

"Probing valley filtering effect by Andreev reflection in zigzag graphene nanoribbon   Ballistic point contact (BPC) with zigzag edges in graphene is a main
candidate of a valley filter, in which the polarization of the valley degree of
freedom can be selected by using a local gate voltage. Here, we propose to
detect the valley filtering effect by Andreev reflection. Because electrons in
the lowest conduction band and the highest valence band of the BPC possess
opposite chirality, the inter-band Andreev reflection is strongly suppressed,
after multiple scattering and interference. We draw this conclusion by both the
scattering matrix analysis and the numerical simulation. The Andreev reflection
as a function of the incident energy of electrons and the local gate voltage at
the BPC is obtained, by which the parameter region for a perfect valley filter
and the direction of valley polarization can be determined. The Andreev
reflection exhibits an oscillatory decay with the length of the BPC, indicating
a negative correlation to valley polarization.

"Generalized Approximate Message-Passing Decoder for Universal Sparse Superposition Codes   Sparse superposition (SS) codes were originally proposed as a
capacity-achieving communication scheme over the additive white Gaussian noise
channel (AWGNC) [1]. Very recently, it was discovered that these codes are
universal, in the sense that they achieve capacity over any memoryless channel
under generalized approximate message-passing (GAMP) decoding [2], although
this decoder has never been stated for SS codes. In this contribution we
introduce the GAMP decoder for SS codes, we confirm empirically the
universality of this communication scheme through its study on various channels
and we provide the main analysis tools: state evolution and potential. We also
compare the performance of GAMP with the Bayes-optimal MMSE decoder. We
empirically illustrate that despite the presence of a phase transition
preventing GAMP to reach the optimal performance, spatial coupling allows to
boost the performance that eventually tends to capacity in a proper limit. We
also prove that, in contrast with the AWGNC case, SS codes for binary input
channels have a vanishing error floor in the limit of large codewords.
Moreover, the performance of Hadamard-based encoders is assessed for practical

"LAAIR: A Layered Architecture for Autonomous Interactive Robots   When developing general purpose robots, the overarching software architecture
can greatly affect the ease of accomplishing various tasks. Initial efforts to
create unified robot systems in the 1990s led to hybrid architectures,
emphasizing a hierarchy in which deliberative plans direct the use of reactive
skills. However, since that time there has been significant progress in the
low-level skills available to robots, including manipulation and perception,
making it newly feasible to accomplish many more tasks in real-world domains.
There is thus renewed optimism that robots will be able to perform a wide array
of tasks while maintaining responsiveness to human operators. However, the top
layer in traditional hybrid architectures, designed to achieve long-term goals,
can make it difficult to react quickly to human interactions during goal-driven
execution. To mitigate this difficulty, we propose a novel architecture that
supports such transitions by adding a top-level reactive module which has
flexible access to both reactive skills and a deliberative control module. To
validate this architecture, we present a case study of its application on a
domestic service robot platform.

"Wehrl Entropy Based Quantification of Nonclassicality for Single Mode Quantum Optical States   Nonclassical states of a quantized light are described in terms of
Glauber-Sudarshan P distribution which is not a genuine classical probability
distribution. Despite several attempts, defining a uniform measure of
nonclassicality (NC) for the single mode quantum states of light is yet an open
task. In our previous work [Phys. Rev. A 95, 012330 (2017)] we have shown that
the existing well-known measures fail to quantify the NC of single mode states
that are generated under multiple NC-inducing operations. Recently, Ivan et.
al. [Quantum. Inf. Process. 11, 853 (2012)] have defined a measure of
non-Gaussian character of quantum optical states in terms of Wehrl entropy.
Here, we adopt this concept in the context of single mode NC. In this paper, we
propose a new quantification of NC for the single mode quantum states of light
as the difference between the total Wehrl entropy of the state and the maximum
Wehrl entropy arising due to its classical characteristics. This we achieve by
subtracting from its Wehrl entropy, the maximum Wehrl entropy attainable by any
classical state that has same randomness as measured in terms of von-Neumann
entropy. We obtain analytic expressions of NC for most of the states, in
particular, all pure states and Gaussian mixed states. However, the evaluation
of NC for the non-Gaussian mixed states is subject to extensive numerical
computation that lies beyond the scope of the current work. We show that, along
with the states generated under single NC-inducing operations, also for the
broader class of states that are generated under multiple NC-inducing
operations, our quantification enumerates the NC consistently.

"An Effective Framework for Constructing Exponent Lattice Basis of Nonzero Algebraic Numbers   Computing a basis for the exponent lattice of algebraic numbers is a basic
problem in the field of computational number theory with applications to many
other areas. The main cost of a well-known algorithm

"Competing evolutionary paths in growing populations with applications to multidrug resistance   Investigating the emergence of a particular cell type is a recurring theme in

x2-y2 component of the axial toroidal quadrupole. This differs from the 3z2-r2
symmetry of the atomic displacements associated with the I-4m2 crystal
structure that was previously thought to be its origin. Within the same
formalism, we suggest that the primary order parameter detected in the SHG
experiment is the 3z2-r2 component of the magnetic quadrupole. We discuss the
general mechanism driving the phase transition in our proposed framework, and
suggest experiments, particularly resonant X-ray scattering ones, that could
clarify this issue.

"Efficient and consistent inference of ancestral sequences in an evolutionary model with insertions and deletions under dense taxon sampling   In evolutionary biology, the speciation history of living organisms is
represented graphically by a phylogeny, that is, a rooted tree whose leaves
correspond to current species and branchings indicate past speciation events.
Phylogenies are commonly estimated from molecular sequences, such as DNA
sequences, collected from the species of interest. At a high level, the idea
behind this inference is simple: the further apart in the Tree of Life are two
species, the greater is the number of mutations to have accumulated in their
genomes since their most recent common ancestor. In order to obtain accurate
estimates in phylogenetic analyses, it is standard practice to employ
statistical approaches based on stochastic models of sequence evolution on a
tree. For tractability, such models necessarily make simplifying assumptions
about the evolutionary mechanisms involved. In particular, commonly omitted are
insertions and deletions of nucleotides -- also known as indels.
Properly accounting for indels in statistical phylogenetic analyses remains a
major challenge in computational evolutionary biology. Here we consider the
problem of reconstructing ancestral sequences on a known phylogeny in a model
of sequence evolution incorporating nucleotide substitutions, insertions and
deletions, specifically the classical TKF91 process. We focus on the case of
dense phylogenies of bounded height, which we refer to as the taxon-rich
setting, where statistical consistency is achievable. We give the first
polynomial-time ancestral reconstruction algorithm with provable guarantees
under constant rates of mutation. Our algorithm succeeds when the phylogeny
satisfies the ""big bang"" condition, a necessary and sufficient condition for
statistical consistency in this context.

"Pattern-forming fronts in a Swift-Hohenberg equation with directional quenching - parallel and oblique stripes   We study the effect of domain growth on the orientation of striped phases in
a Swift-Hohenberg equation. Domain growth is encoded in a step-like parameter
dependence that allows stripe formation in a half plane, and suppresses
patterns in the complement, while the boundary of the pattern-forming region is
propagating with fixed normal velocity. We construct front solutions that leave
behind stripes in the pattern-forming region that are parallel to or at a small
oblique angle to the boundary.
Technically, the construction of stripe formation parallel to the boundary
relies on ill-posed, infinite-dimensional spatial dynamics. Stripes forming at
a small oblique angle are constructed using a functional-analytic, perturbative
approach. Here, the main difficulties are the presence of continuous spectrum
and the fact that small oblique angles appear as a singular perturbation in a
traveling-wave problem. We resolve the former difficulty using a farfield-core
decomposition and Fredholm theory in weighted spaces. The singular perturbation
problem is resolved using preconditioners and boot-strapping.

"Live Service Migration in Mobile Edge Clouds   Mobile edge clouds (MECs) bring the benefits of the cloud closer to the user,
by installing small cloud infrastructures at the network edge. This enables a
new breed of real-time applications, such as instantaneous object recognition
and safety assistance in intelligent transportation systems, that require very
low latency. One key issue that comes with proximity is how to ensure that
users always receive good performance as they move across different locations.
Migrating services between MECs is seen as the means to achieve this. This
article presents a layered framework for migrating active service applications
that are encapsulated either in virtual machines (VMs) or containers. This
layering approach allows a substantial reduction in service downtime. The
framework is easy to implement using readily available technologies, and one of
its key advantages is that it supports containers, which is a promising
emerging technology that offers tangible benefits over VMs. The migration
performance of various real applications is evaluated by experiments under the
presented framework. Insights drawn from the experimentation results are

"Induced density correlations in a sonic black hole condensate   Analog black/white hole pairs, consisting of a region of supersonic flow,
have been achieved in a recent experiment by J. Steinhauer using an elongated
Bose-Einstein condensate. A growing standing density wave, and a checkerboard
feature in the density-density correlation function, were observed in the
supersonic region. We model the density-density correlation function, taking
into account both quantum fluctuations and the shot-to-shot variation of atom
number normally present in ultracold-atom experiments. We find that quantum
fluctuations alone produce some, but not all, of the features of the
correlation function, whereas atom-number fluctuation alone can produce all the
observed features, and agreement is best when both are included. In both cases,
the density-density correlation is not intrinsic to the fluctuations, but
rather is induced by modulation of the standing wave caused by the
fluctuations.

"Genus growth in $\mathbb{Z}_p$-towers of function fields   Let $K$ be a function field over a finite field $k$ of characteristic $p$ and
let $K_{\infty}/K$ be a geometric extension with Galois group $\mathbb{Z}_p$.
Let $K_n$ be the corresponding subextension with Galois group
$\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$ and genus $g_n$. In this paper, we give a simple
explicit formula $g_n$ in terms of an explicit Witt vector construction of the
$\mathbb{Z}_p$-tower. This formula leads to a tight lower bound on $g_n$ which
is quadratic in $p^n$. Furthermore, we determine all $\mathbb{Z}_p$-towers for
which the genus sequence is stable, in the sense that there are $a,b,c \in
\mathbb{Q}$ such that $g_n=a p^{2n}+b p^n +c$ for $n$ large enough. Such genus
stable towers are expected to have strong stable arithmetic properties for
their zeta functions. A key technical contribution of this work is a new

"Accurate and Diverse Sampling of Sequences based on a ""Best of Many"" Sample Objective   For autonomous agents to successfully operate in the real world, anticipation
of future events and states of their environment is a key competence. This
problem has been formalized as a sequence extrapolation problem, where a number
of observations are used to predict the sequence into the future. Real-world
scenarios demand a model of uncertainty of such predictions, as predictions
become increasingly uncertain -- in particular on long time horizons. While
impressive results have been shown on point estimates, scenarios that induce
multi-modal distributions over future sequences remain challenging. Our work
addresses these challenges in a Gaussian Latent Variable model for sequence
prediction. Our core contribution is a ""Best of Many"" sample objective that
leads to more accurate and more diverse predictions that better capture the
true variations in real-world sequence data. Beyond our analysis of improved
model fit, our models also empirically outperform prior work on three diverse
tasks ranging from traffic scenes to weather data.

"Exploring RNN-Transducer for Chinese Speech Recognition   End-to-end approaches have drawn much attention recently for significantly
simplifying the construction of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system.
RNN transducer (RNN-T) is one of the popular end-to-end methods. Previous
studies have shown that RNN-T is difficult to train and a very complex training
process is needed for a reasonable performance. In this paper, we explore RNN-T
for a Chinese large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) task and
aim to simplify the training process while maintaining performance. First, a
new strategy of learning rate decay is proposed to accelerate the model
convergence. Second, we find that adding convolutional layers at the beginning
of the network and using ordered data can discard the pre-training process of
the encoder without loss of performance. Besides, we design experiments to find
a balance among the usage of GPU memory, training circle and model performance.
Finally, we achieve 16.9% character error rate (CER) on our test set which is
2% absolute improvement from a strong BLSTM CE system with language model

"A Debt-Aware Learning Approach for Resource Adaptations in Cloud Elasticity Management   Elasticity is a cloud property that enables applications and its execution
systems to dynamically acquire and release shared computational resources on
demand. Moreover, it unfolds the advantage of economies of scale in the cloud
through a drop in the average costs of these shared resources. However, it is
still an open challenge to achieve a perfect match between resource demand and
provision in autonomous elasticity management. Resource adaptation decisions
essentially involve a trade-off between economics and performance, which
produces a gap between the ideal and actual resource provisioning. This gap, if
not properly managed, can negatively impact the aggregate utility of a cloud
customer in the long run. To address this limitation, we propose a technical
debt-aware learning approach for autonomous elasticity management based on a
reinforcement learning of elasticity debts in resource provisioning; the
adaptation pursues strategic decisions that trades off economics against
performance. We extend CloudSim and Burlap to evaluate our approach. The
evaluation shows that a reinforcement learning of technical debts in elasticity
obtains a higher utility for a cloud customer, while conforming expected levels
of performance.

It has also been shown that transformation optics can be used to gravitational

to linear devices, as a consistent approach to nonlinearity (including both the
case of a nonlinear background medium and a nonlinear transformation) remains

of novel effects, including cloaking an optical soliton, modeling nonlinear
solutions to Einstein's field equations, controlling transport in a Debye
solid, and developing a set of constitutive to relations for relativistic

of the lower and upper bounds is expected to be universal or model-independent:
the present simple simulation model provides generic insight into the physics

development of a more refined coarse-grained model. Relatively abrupt changes
of velocity are predicted near the lower and upper bounds for the scaling
regime and the positions of the bounds could be good markers for the
development of tough polymers, for which we provide simple views that could be
useful as guiding principles for toughening polymer-based materials.

"A note on the fundamental group of Kodaira fibrations   The fundamental group $\pi$ of a Kodaira fibration is, by definition, the
extension of a surface group $\Pi_b$ by another surface group $\Pi_g$, i.e. \[
1 \rightarrow \Pi_g \rightarrow \pi \rightarrow \Pi_b \rightarrow 1. \]
Conversely, we can inquire about what conditions need to be satisfied by a
group of that sort in order to be the fundamental group of a Kodaira fibration.
In this short note we collect some restriction on the image of the classifying
map $m \colon \Pi_b \to \Gamma_g$ in terms of the coinvariant homology of
$\Pi_g$. In particular, we observe that if $\pi$ is the fundamental group of a
Kodaira fibration with relative irregularity $g-s$, then $g \leq 1+ 6s$, and we
show that this effectively constrains the possible choices for $\pi$, namely
that there are group extensions as above that fail to satisfy this bound, hence
cannot be the fundamental group of a Kodaira fibration. In particular this
provides examples of symplectic $4$--manifolds that fail to admit a Kähler
structure for reasons that eschew the usual obstructions.

"Photo-Chemically Directed Self-Assembly of Carbon Nanotubes on Surfaces   Transistors incorporating single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the channel
material are used in a variety of electronics applications. However, a
competitive CNT-based technology requires the precise placement of CNTs at
predefined locations of a substrate. One promising placement approach is to use
chemical recognition to bind CNTs from solution at the desired locations on a
surface. Producing the chemical pattern on the substrate is challenging. Here
we describe a one-step patterning approach based on a highly photosensitive
surface monolayer. The monolayer contains chromophopric group as light
sensitive body with heteroatoms as high quantum yield photolysis center. As
deposited, the layer will bind CNTs from solution. However, when exposed to
ultraviolet (UV) light with a low dose (60 mJ/cm2) similar to that used for
conventional photoresists, the monolayer cleaves and no longer binds CNTs.
These features allow standard, wafer-scale UV lithography processes to be used
to form a patterned chemical monolayer without the need for complex substrate
patterning or monolayer stamping.

"Split-and-augmented Gibbs sampler - Application to large-scale inference problems   This paper derives two new optimization-driven Monte Carlo algorithms

framework enables to derive faster and more efficient sampling schemes than the

efficiently the parameter to infer as well as the hyperparameters of the
problem, the generated samples can be used to approximate Bayesian estimators
of the parameters to infer. Additionally, the proposed approach brings
confidence intervals at a low cost contrary to optimization methods.
Simulations on two often-studied signal processing problems illustrate the

"The effects of subdiffusion on the NTA size measurements of extracellular vesicles in biological samples   The interest in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) is rapidly growing as they
became reliable biomarkers for many diseases. For this reason, fast and
accurate techniques of EVs size characterization are the matter of utmost
importance. One increasingly popular technique is the Nanoparticle Tracking
Analysis (NTA), in which the diameters of EVs are calculated from their
diffusion constants. The crucial assumption here is that the diffusion in NTA
follows the Stokes-Einstein relation, i.e. that the Mean Square Displacement
(MSD) of a particle grows linearly in time (MSD $\propto t$). However, we show
that NTA violates this assumption in both artificial and biological samples,
i.e. a large population of particles show a strongly sub-diffusive behaviour
(MSD $\propto t^\alpha$, $0<\alpha<1$). To support this observation we present
a range of experimental results for both polystyrene beads and EVs. This is
also related to another problem: for the same samples there exists a huge
discrepancy (by the factor of 2-4) between the sizes measured with NTA and with
the direct imaging methods, such as AFM. This can be remedied by e.g. the
Finite Track Length Adjustment (FTLA) method in NTA, but its applicability is
limited in the biological and poly-disperse samples. On the other hand, the
models of sub-diffusion rarely provide the direct relation between the size of
a particle and the generalized diffusion constant. However, we solve this last
problem by introducing the logarithmic model of sub-diffusion, aimed at
retrieving the size data. In result, we propose a novel protocol of NTA data
analysis. The accuracy of our method is on par with FTLA for small
($\simeq$200nm) particles. We apply our method to study the EVs samples and
corroborate the results with AFM.

"Primordial perturbations from inflation with a hyperbolic field-space   We study primordial perturbations from hyperinflation, proposed recently and
based on a hyperbolic field-space. In the previous work, it was shown that the
field-space angular momentum supported by the negative curvature modifies the
background dynamics and enhances fluctuations of the scalar fields
qualitatively, assuming that the inflationary background is almost de Sitter.
In this work, we confirm and extend the analysis based on the standard approach
of cosmological perturbation in multi-field inflation. At the background level,
to quantify the deviation from de Sitter, we introduce the slow-varying
parameters and show that steep potentials, which usually can not drive
inflation, can drive inflation. At the linear perturbation level, we obtain the
power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbation and express the spectral
tilt and running in terms of the slow-varying parameters. We show that
hyperinflation with power-law type potentials has already been excluded by the
recent Planck observations, while exponential-type potential with the exponent
of order unity can be made consistent with observations as far as the power
spectrum is concerned. We also argue that, in the context of a simple $D$-brane
inflation, the hyperinflation requires exponentially large hyperbolic extra
dimensions but that masses of Kaluza-Klein gravitons can be kept relatively
heavy.
